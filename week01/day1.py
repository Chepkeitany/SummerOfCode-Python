# Write a program that tells you the following:

# Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year?
# (Assuming a non-leap year)
hours_in_a_year = 365 * 24
print("There are " + str(hours_in_a_year) + " hours in a year.\n")


# Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade?
minutes_in_a_decade = 10 * 365 * 24 * 60
print("There are " + str(minutes_in_a_decade) + " minutes in a decade.\n")


# Your age in seconds. How many seconds old are you? (I'm not going to check your answer, so be as accurate—or not—as you want.)
my_age_in_seconds = 25 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60
print("My age in seconds is " + str(my_age_in_seconds) + "\n")


# Andreea Visanoiu​: I'm 48618000 seconds old hahaha. Calculate @Andreea Visanoiu's age.
age = 48618000 / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60)
print("Andreea's age is " + str(age) + " years\n")

# How many days does it take for a 32-bit system to timeout, if it has a bug with integer overflow?
# How about a 64-bit system?

# Calculate your age accurately based on your birthday (maybe use time of day e.g. 8:23am if you know it, use 12:00 noon midday) - you will need Python modules.
